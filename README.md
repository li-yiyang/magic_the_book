# magic_the_book
This is a book about computer programming (probably). 
Although I think it would mix in a lot of books I recently
read. (which means that this book would read more like a 
notebook rather than a serious computer book) Because I'm
not learning computer science, I just learn it for fun. 

这本书(大概)是一本介绍计算机编程的书. 但是因为我并不是
计算机科班出身, 所以学习计算机只是学着玩的. 也就是说, 
这本书里面更像是一种学习笔记一样的东西. 

## Why I'm writing this? 
Because I want to have a try. Well, you can say that newborn
calves are not afraid of tigers. Although I do know that it 
would be difficult. However, I hope if the future, I could 
finish it and make it a book which could explain the computer
programming to my friends who learn humanities and languages. 

因为我想逝逝. 虽然我觉得这个可能会是一个要烂尾的工程. 
不过我希望在最后能够写出一本让我的"文科"同学也能学会计算机编程
的一本书. 

## License
I am new to this, (I just learnt a little in my college 
writing class) thus I choose the MIT License, which is short
and simple. Hopefully it would help you in learning computer 
programming. 

我不是很懂, 但是既然大学写作课上学了, 那么就试着选择了
MIT License. 希望这本书能够帮助你学习计算机. 

(However, if you think this book is okay, or if you want to
help me inprove the book, I'm willing to hear from you. )

## Thanks
My friends and my teachers. They bring me the motivation.
